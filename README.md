# Gunshot-Audio-Classifier
Two implementations of neural networks to classify gunshot audio by caliber

While playing a shooter video game I realized the gunshots around me had different sounds, and that I could use them tell if they were coming from my team or the enemy. This idea was interesting and I wanted to know if trained ears could tell the difference on real gunshots. Accounts from veterans online were mixed, with most indicating that the sounds could be broadly identitfied but factors like distance, angle, and rpm made consistent identification via human ears difficult. And so I wanted to see if machine learning could do a better job! The dataset at http://cadreforensics.com/audio/ contains recordings of thousands of gunshots from different angles, distances, and recording devices. I had some trouble with the preprocessing (new to working with audio data) but the guide on Valerio Velardo's youtube channel(https://youtu.be/Oa_d-zaUti8) was a great resource for this.

The results were fairly good! Both methods produced an accuracy around 65%-70%, though the CNN was much more efficient at training. Not bad for 10 possible calibers, fired from a variety of weapons, at varying distances & angles, recorded on 3 different devices. I'm far from an expert at audio data, but I suspect further improvement would require more features than the 13 MFCCs used here.
